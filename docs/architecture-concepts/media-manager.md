# Media Manager

Shopper has a full-fledged Media Manager which allows you to upload files, re-name files, and delete files. You can also add new folders and move files/folders. Basically anything that you would be able to do in any type of Media Manager you can do so in the Shopper Media Manager.

**Notice on File Upload Size**  
If you are getting an error when trying to upload large files, this may be a setting that needs to be changed in your PHP. Be sure to check `max_file_upload` and `file_upload_size`
